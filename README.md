Any files or directories under ```~/data``` will NOT be tracked. Keep local copies of your datasets here.

```~``` refers to the root of the project, NOT the root directory of your computer. This is a shade on myself, I wrote some scripts that were tampering ```~/data``` on my computer and I sometimes feel dumb after making such errors. -Kush
